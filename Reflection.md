# Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? If so, how?

Yes. I used Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT and Windsurf to help me
with some syntax, autocomplete, errors, how to use some
libraries and how to solve a problem after the deploy to
Netlify.

# What did you build or decide manually?

I decided manually to use React, Vite, SWC, Localstorage and
pure CSS and I made the whole Components and styles
manually. In addition to this I made the deploy to Netlify
manually after following Gemini's instructions to solve a
problem with routes.

# Where did you need to think critically or make decisions beyond AI suggestions?

I had to think critically about the components, styling,
validations and authentication.

# What would you improve with more time?

I'd add documentation with Storybook, Unit tests with Jest
and React Testing Library, add animations, icons and improve
validations and styles. Maybe try to implement OAuth as
well.
